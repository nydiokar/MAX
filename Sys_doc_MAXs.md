# MAX+ (Multi-Agent eXpertise Framework) - System Documentation

## System Overview
MAX+ is an agent-based system where specialized AI agents serve as domain experts, supported by a knowledge processing unit (KPU) for reasoning validation. The system emphasizes agent autonomy while maintaining data integrity and logical consistency.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Expert Agents
Primary decision makers with:
- Domain-specific knowledge and reasoning
- Direct access to data stores
- API integration capabilities
- Independent reasoning logic

Source: Custom implementation with Eliza's plugin patterns

### 2. Orchestrator + Classifier
- Routes requests to appropriate agents
- Intent classification using local LLM
- State management
- Error handling and recovery

Source: Existing implementation + Eliza's routing patterns

### 3. Memory System
- ChromaDB: Vector storage, semantic search
- MongoDB: Structured data, configurations
- Memory Manager: Unified access layer
  
Source: Mem0's memory management patterns

### 4. Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU)
Supporting role:
- Logic validation
- Context enrichment
- Consistency checking

Source: Custom implementation based on ReAct architecture

### 5. Plugin Architecture
- Standardized interfaces
- Dynamic loading
- State management
- Communication protocols

Source: Adapted from Eliza framework

## Data Flow and Storage

### Primary Data Flow
1. Agent receives task through Orchestrator
2. Agent:
   - Checks local storage for context
   - Optionally requests KPU validation
   - Makes API calls if needed
   - Performs domain reasoning
   - Saves results to local storage
3. Response returned

### Storage Responsibilities
- ChromaDB: Semantic search, embeddings
- MongoDB: 
  - Structured data
  - Configuration
  - Task history
  - Agent states

## Framework Integrations


### From mem0
- Memory management system
- Vector store integration
- Context retrieval patterns

### From MCP
- Entity relationship handling
- Memory server patterns (future)

- Retry mechanisms
- Fallback options
- State recovery

### Performance
- Response time targets
- Resource utilization
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing
