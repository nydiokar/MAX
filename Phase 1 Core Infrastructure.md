🟢 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Agent Foundation (Fully Expanded)

🔹 Goal: Establish the multi-agent execution system with memory handling, orchestration, and inter-agent communication.

⏳ Estimated Time: 2-3 weeks

🎯 Success Criteria:

✅ Agents spawn dynamically and communicate.
✅ Memory system operational with hybrid retrieval.
✅ RAG tested and optimized for best performance.
✅ Supervisor Agent manages multi-agent routing.

📋 Checkpoints & Expanded Tasks

📌 [1.1] Orchestrator & Supervisor Setup

🔹 Goal: Implement the core routing system for query delegation, multi-agent execution, and response validation.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Orchestrator Refactor
1. Refactor Orchestrator to support multi-agent execution

   1.1 Modify agent selection logic to dynamically pick agents based on intent classification.
   1.2 Implement task delegation workflows (e.g., Memory → Reasoning → Execution).
   1.3 Allow multiple agents to collaborate on a single task if required.
   1.4 Implement a response aggregator (Orchestrator merges multi-agent responses into a final structured reply).

## Supervisor Agent
 2. Implement Supervisor Agent for intelligent delegation
   2.1 Create Agent Registry where Supervisor keeps track of available agents.
   2.2 Implement workload balancing (distribute queries to prevent agent overload).
   2.3 Implement fallback logic (if an agent fails, retry with another).
   2.4 Enable Supervisor to request clarifications if responses are uncertain.
   2.5 Introduce task history tracking (Supervisor maintains logs of agent queries & resolutions).

💡 Hint: Store agent states in a lightweight Redis cache for fast availability lookups.

✅ Deliverable:
✔ Orchestrator & Supervisor are fully functional, ensuring that agents are correctly assigned and managed.

📌 [1.2] Multi-Agent Infrastructure
🔹 Goal: Define fundamental agents, their communication model, and lifecycle.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Agent Roles & Registration
 3. Define Core Agent Roles

   3.1 Memory Agent → Stores & retrieves knowledge.
   3.2 Reasoning Agent → Breaks down complex queries.
   3.3 Introspection Agent → Validates AI-generated responses.
   3.4 Execution Agent → Handles task workflows.
 
 4. Implement Agent Registration System

   4.1 Each agent registers itself with the Supervisor upon startup.
   4.2 Agents should expose APIs or messaging endpoints to process queries.
   4.3 Implement agent status tracking (Available, Busy, Failed).

💡 Hint: Use a configuration file or API endpoint to allow easy addition of new agents.

✅ Deliverable:
✔ Agents spawn dynamically, register with Supervisor, and communicate efficiently.

📌 [1.3] Memory System
🔹 Goal: Implement hybrid retrieval (short-term & long-term memory) with vectorized storage.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Memory System Core Implementation
 5. Integrate ChromaDB for vector storage

   5.1 Install & configure ChromaDB with the correct embedding model.
   5.2 Set up indexing for efficient semantic search.
   5.3 Enable CRUD operations (store, retrieve, delete old memories).
 
 6. Implement Short-Term vs. Long-Term Memory

   6.1 Short-term memory should be stored in Redis or an LRU-based cache.
   6.2 Long-term memory should persist in ChromaDB or MongoDB.
   6.3 Implement a decay function (older memories gradually lose priority).
   6.4 Session memory should reset periodically, but long-term knowledge remains persistent.

## Memory Retrieval & RAG
 7. Compare RAG vs. standard vector retrieval

   7.1 Implement a RAG pipeline that queries external knowledge if needed.
   7.2 Benchmark retrieval speed and relevance between the two.
   7.3 Optimize query embeddings for better recall accuracy.

💡 Hint: Implement a hybrid memory lookup that first checks short-term cache, then long-term storage.

✅ Deliverable:
✔ Fully operational memory system with short-term, long-term, and RAG-enhanced retrieval.

📌 [1.4] Inter-Agent Communication
🔹 Goal: Ensure agents can exchange data, request knowledge, and escalate tasks.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Internal Messaging System
 8. Implement a message-passing layer

   8.1 Use Redis Pub/Sub or ZeroMQ for real-time event-based messaging.
   8.2 Ensure message routing logic is clear (Supervisor directs messages properly).
   8.3 Implement priority queues (urgent tasks are processed first).

## Enable Agents to Query Memory & Request Context

   8.4 Memory Agent exposes API for knowledge lookups.
   8.5 If a response lacks context, agents should automatically request memory enrichment.
   8.6 Implement Supervisor-driven escalation (if an agent is stuck, the Supervisor reassigns the query).

## Logging & Debugging
 9. Implement full agent logging for debugging

   9.1 Each agent should log incoming & outgoing requests.
   9.2 Log all Supervisor delegation decisions to analyze efficiency.

💡 Hint: Logging should be lightweight but provide enough data to diagnose inter-agent workflow problems.

✅ Deliverable:
✔ Fully operational agent messaging system with task escalation, logging, and debugging.

✅ End of Phase 1 Deliverables
✔ Orchestrator & Supervisor properly manage agent execution.
✔ Memory system is fully operational, with hybrid retrieval strategies.
✔ Multi-agent messaging framework enables seamless collaboration.
✔ Agents dynamically register, communicate, and delegate tasks.
