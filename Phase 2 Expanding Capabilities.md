🟡 Phase 2: Expanding Capabilities & Tool Execution (Fully Expanded)

🔹 Goal: Enable reasoning workflows, tool execution, and agent self-optimization.

⏳ Estimated Time: 3-4 weeks

🎯 Success Criteria:

✅ Agents leverage external tools dynamically.
✅ Orchestrator assigns tasks based on query intent.
✅ Multi-agent workflows operate seamlessly.

📋 Checkpoints & Expanded Tasks

📌 [2.1] Tool Execution Layer
🔹 Goal: Allow agents to execute tools, APIs, and local functions dynamically.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Extract & Implement Tool Execution
1. Extract MCP-based tool execution from AI-Chat

    1.1 Migrate tool registry system from AI-Chat to MAX.
    1.2 Enable dynamic tool registration (new tools can be added without a system restart).
    1.3 Refactor existing tool execution framework to fit MAX’s modular system.

2. Implement Tool Management Agent

    2.1 Track available tools in a centralized tool registry.
    2.2 Create an API layer where agents can request tool execution dynamically.
    2.3 Define a standardized input/output format so all tools return structured data.
    2.4 Implement tool dependency tracking (some tools require specific memory context before execution).

3. Test & Optimize Tool Usage

    3.1 Ensure tools can be used dynamically (agents query the Tool Management Agent when needed).
    3.2 Integrate API-based tools (e.g., external web search, weather API).
    3.3 Integrate local execution tools (e.g., script execution, file processing).
    3.4 Implement a logging system to track tool execution success/failures.

💡 Hint: Use a centralized API gateway to expose available tools instead of hardcoding them in agents.

✅ Deliverable: Tool execution system is fully integrated into MAX.

📌 [2.2] Advanced Orchestration & Task Execution
🔹 Goal: Enhance task prioritization, delegation, and workload management.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Improve Orchestrator Logic
4. Expand Orchestrator's routing logic

    4.1 Route reasoning-heavy queries to the Reasoning Agent.
    4.2 Route memory-heavy queries to the Memory Agent.
    4.3 Route tool-based queries to the Tool Management Agent.
    4.4 Enable fallback logic if an agent fails or returns an uncertain response.

5. Implement task prioritization & delegation rules

    5.1 Define query complexity scoring (low, medium, high).
    5.2 Ensure high-priority tasks get processed first.
    5.3 Allow Supervisor Agent to redistribute workload dynamically.

## Enhance Task Execution & Optimization
6. Enable multi-step task execution

    6.1 Ensure complex queries are broken into smaller steps.
    6.2 Implement task reassignment if the current agent is stuck.
    6.3 Log workflow execution for debugging & efficiency analysis.

💡 Hint: Use a priority queue to manage task scheduling efficiently.

✅ Deliverable: Orchestrator now dynamically routes and prioritizes agent workflows.

📌 [2.3] Multi-Step Workflows
🔹 Goal: Ensure agents can collaborate effectively on multi-step tasks.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Enable Sequential Execution (Step-by-Step Task Handling)
7. Implement workflow state tracking

    7.1 Track in-progress, completed, and failed tasks.
    7.2 Store task dependencies (e.g., Memory → Reasoning → Execution).

8. Enable agents to pass outputs between each other

    8.1 Enable Parallel Execution for Performance Optimization
    8.2 Allow certain workflows to run in parallel
    8.3 Implement structured data exchange format so agents understand each other's responses.

## Enable Parallel Execution for Performance Optimization
9. Allow certain workflows to run in parallel

    9.1 Implement asynchronous execution where applicable.
    9.2 Ensure Supervisor Agent correctly merges parallel task outputs.
 
10 .Introduce a failover mechanism

    10.1 If an agent fails, Supervisor reassigns the task automatically.
    10.2 Implement auto-retry for temporary failures.

💡 Hint: Implement a state machine that keeps track of each task’s stage in the workflow.

✅ Deliverable: Multi-agent workflows now operate in both sequential and parallel execution modes.

✅ End of Phase 2 Deliverables
✔ Tool execution fully integrated into MAX.
✔ Dynamic multi-agent workflow routing operational.
✔ Supervisor Agent autonomously delegates & manages tasks.
✔ Agents collaborate in real-time to solve complex queries.
