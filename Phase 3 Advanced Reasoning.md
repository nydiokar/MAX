🟠 Phase 3: Advanced Reasoning & Introspection (Fully Expanded)

🔹 Goal: Introduce self-reflection, error detection, and self-optimization to improve AI reasoning capabilities.

⏳ Estimated Time: 3-4 weeks

🎯 Success Criteria:

✅ AI evaluates its own outputs & corrects errors.
✅ Introspection Agent detects inconsistencies.
✅ System learns from past errors and improves reasoning.

📋 Checkpoints & Expanded Tasks

📌 [3.1] Self-Reflection & Introspection Agent
🔹 Goal: Implement an Introspection Agent that can evaluate multi-agent responses and ensure correctness.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Implement Introspection Agent
1. Create a specialized agent responsible for response evaluation

   - 1.1 Define evaluation criteria (factual accuracy, logical consistency, reasoning clarity).
   - 1.2 Allow Orchestrator & Supervisor to request validation from the Introspection Agent.
   - 1.3 Implement feedback scoring for agents (track correctness over multiple interactions).
 
 2. Enable response refinement and verification

   - 2.1 If a response is uncertain, Supervisor asks Introspection Agent to refine it.
   - 2.2 Introspection Agent reassesses and refines the reasoning chain before finalizing output.

3. Implement contradiction detection

   - 3.1 Compare current response with historical responses to detect inconsistencies.
   - 3.2 If a contradiction is found, Supervisor Agent reassigns query for review.

💡 Hint: Use embedding similarity techniques to compare responses for internal consistency checks.

✅ Deliverable: Introspection Agent fully operational, validating responses and ensuring consistency.

📌 [3.2] Recursive Reasoning & Decision Optimization
🔹 Goal: Allow agents to reassess, refine, and optimize reasoning steps dynamically.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Enable Recursive Reasoning
4. Introduce recursion in reasoning workflows

   - 4.1 Implement multi-step verification loops (if confidence is low, rerun reasoning).
   - 4.2 Allow Supervisor to trigger a reasoning reset when a faulty step is detected.
   - 4.3 Ensure recursion stops at a maximum depth (to prevent infinite loops).

5. Optimize task scheduling based on past performance

   - 5.1 Assign more complex tasks to higher-performing agents (based on feedback scoring).
   - 5.2 Track which agents perform best under different types of reasoning queries.

6. Improve Confidence Scoring Mechanisms

   - 6.1 Agents should rate their own confidence in responses
   - 6.2 Define scoring scale (e.g., 0.0 - 1.0 confidence).
   - 6.3 If confidence is too low, trigger recursive reasoning before finalizing the output.

💡 Hint: Use fuzzy logic to implement uncertainty thresholds that control recursion depth.

✅ Deliverable: Agents can recursively refine their reasoning, optimizing for accuracy and consistency.

📌 [3.3] Error Handling & Adaptive Learning
🔹 Goal: Enable agents to track errors, learn from past mistakes, and improve autonomously.

✅ Tasks & Subtasks

## Implement Error Tracking & Analysis
7. Introduce an error log that tracks incorrect responses

   - 7.1 Log failed or inaccurate reasoning steps for debugging.
   - 7.2 Track which agent produced the error and adjust reasoning accordingly.

8. Enable response correction mechanisms

   - 8.1 Allow Supervisor to flag incorrect outputs and request revisions.
   - 8.2 Introspection Agent compares current responses with previous mistakes to avoid repeating errors.

## Integrate Self-Optimization & Learning
9. Enable system-wide learning from past mistakes

   - 9.1 Agents update internal knowledge bases when errors are detected.
   - 9.2 If the same mistake occurs repeatedly, Supervisor automatically reconfigures reasoning paths.

💡 Hint: Introduce a knowledge reinforcement loop where incorrect answers update knowledge embeddings to avoid repeating mistakes.

✅ Deliverable: Agents track and correct errors while optimizing their reasoning over time.

✅ End of Phase 3 Deliverables
✔ Introspection Agent operational, validating reasoning & detecting contradictions.
✔ Recursive reasoning implemented, allowing agents to refine their logic dynamically.
✔ Error tracking & adaptive learning ensure continuous improvement of responses.
