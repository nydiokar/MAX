📋 Checkpoints & Tasks

[1.1] Orchestrator & Supervisor Setup
 - Refactor Orchestrator to handle dynamic multi-agent execution.
 - Implement Supervisor Agent to:
   - Manage agent availability.
   - Delegate tasks based on context & priority.
   - Oversee task execution feedback loops.

[1.2] Multi-Agent Infrastructure
 - Implement agent registration system (Supervisor tracks available agents).
 - Define Memory, Reasoning, Introspection, and Execution agent roles.
 - Create a message-passing layer for inter-agent communication.

[1.3] Memory System
 - Integrate ChromaDB for vectorized memory storage.
 - Implement short-term vs. long-term memory differentiation.
 - Develop retrieval scoring system (context relevance, decay mechanism).
 - Test & compare RAG-enhanced retrieval vs. existing lookup.

[1.4] Inter-Agent Communication
 - Implement internal messaging framework for multi-agent workflows.
 - Ensure agents can query memory, share context, and escalate tasks.
 - Add logging for agent interactions to diagnose workflow issues.

✅ End of Phase 1 Deliverables:
- Functional multi-agent execution framework.
- Basic Orchestrator + Supervisor Agent working.
- ChromaDB fully integrated with memory handling.
- RAG evaluated and retrieval system optimized.


🟡 Phase 2: Expanding Capabilities & Tool Execution

🔹 Goal: Enable reasoning workflows, tool execution, and agent self-optimization.

⏳ Estimated Time: 3-4 weeks

🎯 Success Criteria:

✅ Agents leverage external tools dynamically.
✅ Orchestrator assigns tasks based on query intent.
✅ Multi-agent workflows operate seamlessly.

📋 Checkpoints & Tasks

[2.1] Tool Execution Layer
 - Extract MCP tool execution from AI-Chat and integrate into MAX.
 - Create Tool Management Agent to:
   - Register new tools dynamically.
   - Execute API-based tools (weather, search, etc.).
   - Execute local tools (file processing, command execution).

[2.2] Advanced Orchestration & Task Execution
 - Expand Orchestrator logic to:
   - Route reasoning-heavy queries to the Reasoning Agent.
   - Route memory-heavy queries to the Memory Agent.
   - Route tool-based queries to the Tool Management Agent.
   - Implement task prioritization & delegation rules.
   - Ensure Supervisor Agent can reassess and reassign tasks dynamically.

[2.3] Multi-Step Workflows
 - Implement sequential and parallel execution for task handling.
 - Enable agents to pass outputs between each other (e.g., Memory → Reasoning → Execution).
 - Introduce basic failover system (if an agent fails, reassign the task).

✅ End of Phase 2 Deliverables:

- Tool execution fully integrated.
- Dynamic multi-agent workflow routing operational.
- Supervisor Agent autonomously delegates & manages tasks.
- Agents collaborate in real-time to solve complex queries.

🟠 Phase 3: Advanced Reasoning & Introspection

🔹 Goal: Introduce self-reflection, error detection, and self-optimization.

⏳ Estimated Time: 3-4 weeks

🎯 Success Criteria:

✅ AI evaluates its own outputs & corrects errors.
✅ Introspection Agent detects inconsistencies.
✅ System learns from past errors.
📋 Checkpoints & Tasks

[3.1] Self-Reflection & Introspection Agent
 - Implement Introspection Agent that:
   - Evaluates reasoning steps before sending a response.
   - Detects contradictions in multi-agent responses.
   - Flags uncertain outputs for re-evaluation.
   - Enable Supervisor to request clarifications from Introspection Agent.

[3.2] Recursive Reasoning & Decision Optimization
 - Introduce recursive reasoning loops (re-run queries if needed).
 - Optimize task scheduling & execution strategy.
 - Implement confidence scoring on responses.

[3.3] Error Handling & Adaptive Learning
 - Implement error tracking for failed or incorrect responses.
 - Allow agents to learn from past errors (track response history).
 - Enable Supervisor Agent to correct reasoning mistakes over time.

✅ End of Phase 3 Deliverables:
- AI self-evaluates and refines responses.
- Agents improve reasoning dynamically.
- Supervisor Agent handles error detection & mitigation.

🔴 Phase 4: Full System Scalability & Deployment

🔹 Goal: Finalize, deploy, and stress-test the system for high-load tasks.

⏳ Estimated Time: 4-6 weeks

🎯 Success Criteria:

✅ AI operates efficiently under heavy loads.
✅ Agents handle large-scale queries with minimal latency.
✅ Fully documented, debugged, and scalable system.

📋 Checkpoints & Tasks

[4.1] Performance & Latency Optimization
 - Implement asynchronous execution to optimize task execution speed.
 - Optimize memory lookups & agent coordination for lower latency.
 - Implement load balancing & cache layers.

[4.2] Scaling Multi-Agent Workflows
 - Implement dynamic team-based execution (group of agents solving complex queries).
 - Allow Supervisor to create temporary agent groups based on task complexity.
 - Introduce agent load balancing to prevent system overload.

[4.3] Final Deployment & Testing
 - Conduct stress tests under simulated heavy workloads.
 - Deploy to containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes).
 - Set up performance monitoring & logging.

✅ End of Phase 4 Deliverables:
- Scalable system handling complex multi-agent queries.
- Optimized for real-world usage.
- Fully documented, with stress-tested performance.
