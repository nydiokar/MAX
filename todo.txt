Test KPU, task expert, storage models and protocols


With this approach, you can use a single MongoDBRetriever instance for all your agents, and each agent will have its own AgentOptions specifying the collection name and any other retrieval options specific to that agent.
This way, the TaskAgent will retrieve data from the "tasks" collection, the TweetAgent will retrieve data from the "tweets" collection, and the MarketDataAgent will retrieve data from the "market_data" collection, all using the same MongoDBRetriever instance.
You can extend the AgentOptions class to include additional retrieval options specific to each agent, such as query filters, projection fields, sorting criteria, etc.




------------------------- memory_manager integration with the other components-------------------------
- Agents: Add memory integration for storing and retrieving analysis
- Fetchers: Remove local caching, use memory system
- Classifiers: Use memory for context and history
- Orchestrator: Coordinate memory operations

don't forget to add Knowledge Graph Memory Server 


Let me break this down into a clear action plan, showing what components to use from each framework and why:

Core Infrastructure (Your Existing):

Keep MongoDBChatStorage and ChromaDBChatStorage
Keep your current Orchestrator
Keep your Classifier system

Memory & Knowledge (From mem0):

Implement graph-based memory using mem0's graph.py
Purpose: Complex relationship tracking between information
Integration point: Add to your MemorySystem class

Plugin System (From Eliza):

Base structure for modularity
Convert their TypeScript plugins to Python using pattern I showed earlier
Key plugins to port:

Web search
Image generation
Voice chat
Trading integrations


Goals System (New Component):

Build from scratch using the simplified example I showed
Purpose: Long-term task tracking and agent objectives
Integration point: Add to Orchestrator


Enhanced Runtime Context (Adapted from Eliza):

Adapt their state management patterns
Purpose: Better context handling for agent responses
Integration point: Enhance your existing orchestrator


Knowledge Graph (From MCP):


Use for structured storage of entity relationships
Purpose: Track relationships between concepts/entities
Integration point: Integrate with MemorySystem

Recommended Order of Implementation:

Plugin System first - gives immediate extensibility
Memory/Knowledge System second - enhances agent responses
Goals System third - adds long-term context
Runtime enhancements last - optimizes overall system

Framework Usage Summary:

mem0: Use for core memory and knowledge graph
MCP: Use for entity relationship tracking
Eliza: Use for plugin architecture patterns
Your Existing: Keep as foundation, enhance with above



------------ add this to main script ------------

Hereâ€™s how the initialization will look without TTL:

python
Copy code
class MongoDBChatStorage(ChatStorage):
    def __init__(self, mongo_uri: str, db_name: str, collection_name: str):
        self.client = AsyncIOMotorClient(mongo_uri)
        self.collection = self.client[db_name][collection_name]

        # No TTL index applied. All conversations persist indefinitely.
        Logger.info(f"MongoDB storage initialized for collection: {collection_name}")


--------- Pass to Orchestrator: ------------

python
Copy code
orchestrator = MultiAgentOrchestrator(storage=storage)
